TimeFlow by Jetpack Compose in Android.

### Project

- Modified from [TimeFlow](https://github.com/DIPENG-XU/TimeFlow), but the old project coded by
  View, in this new project, I choose Jetpack Compose to build the UI.

- Besides, I use the Automatic injection framework to generate something, which is easier to build
  the code.

- Recode the ViewModel, which is more suitable from Jetpack Compose when I need to use the state in
  UI.
